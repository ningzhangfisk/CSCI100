### 3.1.1 Input Devices
+ An input device is any hardware component that allows you to enter data and instructions into a computer.

### 3.1.2 Output Devices
+ An output device is any hardware component that conveys information to one or more people.

### 3.1.3 System Unit
+ The system unit is a case that contains the electronic components of the computer that are used to process data.

#### 3.1.3.1 [Motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard)
+ It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other [peripherals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral).

#### 3.1.3.2 [central processing unit (CPU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)
+ A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program.
+ CPU can not understand the programming language (e.g. C++, Java, Python...) directly. CPU is controlled by [Machine Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code).
+ The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program.

#### 3.1.3.3 [Heat Sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_sink)
+ A heat sink (also commonly spelled heatsink[1]) is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature.
+ In computers, heat sinks are used to cool CPUs, GPUs, and some chipsets and RAM modules.

#### 3.1.3.4 [Random-access memory(RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)
+ Random-access memory (RAM; /r√¶m/) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store **working** data and machine code(what will happen if the computer is shut down?).
+ A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory), where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

#### 3.1.3.5 [Hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive)
+ A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material(what will happen if the computer is shut down?).

#### 3.1.3.5 [Graphics processing unit(GPU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)
+ A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device.
