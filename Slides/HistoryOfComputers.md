# 2. History of Computers

## 2.1 Cogs and Calculators
+ In 1642, aged only 18, French scientist and philosopher Blaise Pascal (1623–1666) invented the first practical mechanical calculator, the **Pascaline**, to help his tax-collector father do his sums.
+ The machine had a series of interlocking cogs (gear wheels with teeth around their outer edges) that could add and subtract decimal numbers.

+ In 1671, German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) came up with a similar but more advanced machine. Instead of using cogs, it had a "stepped drum" (a cylinder with teeth of increasing length around its edge), an innovation that survived in mechanical calculators for 300 hundred years. The Leibniz machine could do much more than Pascal's: as well as adding and subtracting, it could multiply, divide, and work out square roots. Another pioneering feature was the first memory store or "register." Apart from developing one of the world's earliest mechanical calculators, Leibniz is remembered for another important contribution to computing: he was the man who invented binary code.

## 2.2 Engines of Calculation
+ Charles Babbage (1791-1871) , computer pioneer, designed the first automatic computing engines. He invented computers but failed to build them. The first complete Babbage Engine was completed in London in 2002, 153 years after it was designed.
+ Neither the abacus, nor the mechanical calculators constructed by Pascal and Leibniz really qualified as computers.(it needs a human operator)
+ A computer, on the other hand, is a machine that can operate automatically, without any human help.

## 2.3 Turing machine
+ Alan Turing(1912-1954) was a brilliant Cambridge mathematician whose major contributions were to the theory of how computers processed information.

## 2.4 The first modern computers
+  The first large-scale digital computer appeared in 1944 at Harvard University, built by mathematician  Howard Aiken (1900-1973), sponsored by IBM. It is also known as **Harward Mark I**.

+ **Colossus** was the world’s first electronic, digital, programmable computer. British codebreakers used Colossus to read secret
German messages during World War II.

## 2.5 First [Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler)
+ Grace Hopper (1906 -1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy Rear Admiral. She invented the first compiler for a computer programming language. The A-0 system (Arithmetic Language version 0), was the first compiler ever developed for an electronic computer.

## 2.6 A legendary bug
+ In 1947, a physical malfunction in the Mark II computer was traced back to a moth stuck in one of the relays. Grace Hopper taped it to the operations logbook with the annotation ”First actual case of bug being found”.

## 2.7 The microelectronic revolution
+ Integrated circuits , as much as transistors, helped to shrink computers during the 1960s. As the 1960s wore on, integrated circuits became increasingly sophisticated and compact. Soon, engineers were speaking of **large-scale integration(LSI)**, and then **very large-scale integrated (VLSI)**.
