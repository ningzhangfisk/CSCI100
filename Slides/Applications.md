### 3.2.3 Web Application
+ A web application (or web app) is application software that runs in a web browser, unlike software programs that run locally and natively on the operating system (OS) of the device.
+ Web applications are delivered on the `World Wide Web` to users with an active network connection.
+ Web applications are usually coded in browser-supported language such as JavaScript and HTML as these languages rely on the browser to render the program executable.
+ Some applications are dynamic, requiring server-side processing. Others are completely static with no processing required at the server.
+ The web application requires a web server to manage requests from the client, an application server to perform the tasks requested, and, sometimes, a database to store the information.
#### 3.2.3.1 A typical web application flow
+ 1. User triggers a request to the web server over the internet, either through a web browser or the application’s user interface
+ 2. Web server forwards this request to the appropriate web application server
+ 3. Web application server performs the requested task – such as querying the database or processing the data – then generates the results of the requested data
+ 4. Web application server sends results to the web server with the requested information or processed data
+ 5. Web server responds back to the client with the requested information that then appears on the user’s display
#### 3.2.3.2 Example of a web application
+ Web applications include online forms, shopping carts, word processors, spreadsheets, video and photo editing, file conversion, file scanning, and email programs such as Gmail, Yahoo and AOL. Popular applications include Google Apps and Microsoft 365.
+ Google Apps for Work has Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, online storage and more. Other functionalities include online sharing of documents and calendars. This lets all team members access the same version of a document simultaneously.

#### 3.2.4 Cloud Apps
+ Cloud applications are software that users access primarily through the internet, meaning at least some of it is managed by a server and not users' local machines.
+ If designed well, cloud applications can offer a user experience like a program installed entirely on a local machine, but with reduced resource needs, more convenient updating, and the ability to access functionality across different devices.
